these are not meant to be of any general use. 


=head2 show_version()

This prints the version number and exits.

=cut

sub show_version {
	my $name = $0;
	$name =~ s!^\.\/!!;
	printf "This is %s %s %s\nUse flags -h or --help for help.\n", $name, $VERSION->stringify, $BRANCH ? qq~($BRANCH)~ : '';
	exit;
}

=head2 abs_path() 

This will create an absolute path via rel2abs(), but always uses slashes and never 
backslash, even on Windows. The path is meant to be used inside R.

=cut

sub abs_path {
	my $abs = rel2abs(shift);
	$abs =~ tr/\\/\//;
	return $abs;
